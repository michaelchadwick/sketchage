# Sketchage

Building off of [mixophrygian](https://github.com/mixophrygian)'s original ["Etcha-sketch"](https://mixophrygian.github.io/) web app, I thought I'd try to make it even more awesome because *reasons*.

* Completely redesigned interface and color scheme
* Updated to HTML5
* Refactored jQuery
* Change grid width/height
* Change square count from main interface
* Click to draw by default (with "clickless" mode still available)
* Colorpicker tool
* Help box
* Save your image to BMP
