# Sketchage

Building off of [mixophrygian](https://github.com/mixophrygian)'s original ["Etcha-sketch"](https://mixophrygian.github.io/) web app, I thought I'd try to make it even more awesome because *reasons*.

* Completely redesigned interface and color scheme
* Updated to HTML5
* Refactored jQuery
* Change grid width/height
* Change square count from main interface
* Click to draw by default (with "clickless" mode still available)
* Rainbow color mode
* Colorpicker tool
* Save your image to BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG

## Color Stuff

* [bitmap.js](http://mrcoles.com/low-res-paint)
* [jscolor](https://jscolor.com) is the bee's knees.

## Ruler

Thanks to Mads Stoumann for the help on [making a ruler](https://dev.to/madsstoumann/build-a-css-ruler-2opn), and [jQuery.Transit](https://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit) for positioning it.
